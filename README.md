# Anthony Silva

I'm a developer with interests in backend systems, web infrastructure, and building technical projects from the ground up. Outside of development, I also work in photography and creative media. I enjoy learning new technologies, refining my skillset, and working on long-term projects that let me experiment and grow.

### What I'm Working On
- Continuing development on **Casper**, a virtual world project built using Java and custom backend systems.
- Expanding my knowledge of **Java**, with a focus on server architecture and clean backend design.
- Planning a deeper dive into **Python** for future automation tools and service utilities.
